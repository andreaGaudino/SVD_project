# SVD for Image and Audio Compression

This project explores how Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) can be applied to efficiently compress image and audio data.
Starting from a high-quality image and a short voice recording, the study demonstrates how reducing the number of singular values allows for a significant decrease in storage size while maintaining good perceptual quality. Through visual and auditory experiments, the work highlights the balance between compression rate and reconstruction quality, showing how SVD can capture the most meaningful features of complex data with minimal information loss.

This project was developed as part of the Computational Linear Algebra for Large Scale Problems course at Politecnico di Torino (A.Y. 2024/25).
